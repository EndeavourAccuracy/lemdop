===[4 - THANKS]================================================================

Jordan Mechner, created Prince of Persia.

David of the Princed forum, documented the PoP for Mega Drive and Sega Genesis file formats. I could not have created lemdop without this documentation.

===[5 - FEEDBACK]==============================================================

If lemdop crashes, gets compilation errors or crashes while building, send an e-mail to [ mail@norbertdejonge.nl ]. Make sure to describe exactly what actions triggered the bug and the precise symptoms of the bug. If possible, also include: 'uname -a', 'gcc -v', 'sdl2-config --version', and 'lemdop --version'.

===[7 - (RE)COMPILING]=========================================================

GNU/Linux
=========

$ make

You will need libsdl2-dev, libsdl2-image-dev and libsdl2-ttf-dev.

Windows (64-bit)
================

1) Set up Dev-C++:

1.1 Download

http://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/files/Setup%20Releases/
or
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/orwelldevcpp/Setup%20Releases/
  Dev-Cpp%205.11%20TDM-GCC%204.9.2%20Setup.exe

1.2 Install

Simply run the executable.

2) Install SDL2's MinGW libraries:

2.1 Download

http://libsdl.org/release/
  SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw.tar.gz
http://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/
  SDL2_ttf-devel-2.0.13-mingw.tar.gz
http://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/
  SDL2_image-devel-2.0.1-mingw.tar.gz

2.2 Install

Unpack the packages.

For all three packages, copy the contents of the x86_64-w64-mingw32/ directory into the Dev-Cpp/MinGW64/x86_64-w64-mingw32/ directory.

GNU/Linux users who use Wine can find this directory at:
~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Dev-Cpp/MinGW64/x86_64-w64-mingw32/

Copy the Dev-Cpp/MinGW64/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/*.dll files to the lemdop directory.
(You do not need libjpeg-9.dll, libtiff-5.dll and libwebp-4.dll.)
